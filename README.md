Forkify is a VanillaJS application where users can search, create, and bookmark recipes.

# Features

1. Recipe Search: Users can search for recipes by entering keywords into the search bar. The application fetches recipes from the Forkify API based on the user's query.

2. Recipe Display: Search results are displayed by showing recipe cards with images, titles, and summary information.

3. Recipe Details: Clicking on a recipe card reveals additional details about the selected recipe, including ingredients, preparation instructions, serving sizes, and cooking time. 

4. Recipe Bookmarks: Users have the option to bookmark their favorite recipes for quick access later. Bookmarked recipes are stored locally in the browser's storage.

5. Ingredient Quantity Adjustment: Users can adjust the quantities of ingredients in a recipe based on the number of servings they intend to make. The application automatically recalculates ingredient amounts accordingly.
