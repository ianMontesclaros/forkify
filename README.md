# Features

1. Recipe Search: Users can search for recipes by entering keywords or ingredients into the search bar. The application fetches recipes from an external API based on the user's query.

2. Recipe Display: Search results are displayed in a visually appealing manner, showing recipe cards with images, titles, and summary information. Users can scroll through the search results to find recipes that interest them.

3. Recipe Details: Clicking on a recipe card reveals additional details about the selected recipe, including ingredients, preparation instructions, serving sizes, and nutritional information. Users can view the full recipe within the application.

4. Recipe Bookmarks: Users have the option to bookmark their favorite recipes for quick access later. Bookmarked recipes are stored locally in the browser's storage.

5. Ingredient Quantity Adjustment: Users can adjust the quantities of ingredients in a recipe based on the number of servings they intend to make. The application automatically recalculates ingredient amounts accordingly.

6. Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a consistent user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
